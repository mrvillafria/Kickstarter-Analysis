# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to help Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, analyze and sort data so she can start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play, Fever. The analysis compared different crowdfunding campaigns based on their launch dates and funding goals. In addition to analyzing and sorting the data, we created visualizations so Louise could see outcomes in a form thatâ€™s easier to understand and highlights useful information.

## Analysis and Challenges



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

One of the areas we wanted to consider was timing for campaigns. We created a table and line with markers chart that showed how many successful, failed, and cancelled theater campaigns there were based on which month they launched on. The results show that May and June had the highest success rate to start a theater campaign. It also showed that December had around the same amount of successful and failed theater campaigns. May and June look like the best time to start a theater campaign since they had the most successful projects and the highest number of total theater projects during those months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Another area we wanted to examine was looking at the outcomes based on the goal amount. We created a chart and a table that broke the goals down into dollar amount ranges and calculated the number of successful, failed, or cancelled play campaigns. We then calculated the percentage of successful, failed, or cancelled projects and used this information in our line chart. When the goal was less than $1000 for 186 play projects, it had the highest success percentage and lowest failed percentage. In this scenario, around 76% of play campaigns that had goals of less than $1000 were successful and around 24% of play campaigns failed. Also looking at goals between $1000 to $4999, there were 534 total play projects, and they had a success rate of around 73% and around 27% failed. In conclusion, having a goal between less than $1000 to $4999 has the highest success percentage and yields the highest number of total projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
