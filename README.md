# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

During this project, we use Excel as a tool to better understand a large amount of data from Kickstarter. Kickstarter is a platform that allows people to showcase their projects and helps them start a campaign to raise money to fund their projects. This data set that we were given is composed of 4,000 different campaigns ranging in different categories. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to help Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, analyze and sort data so she can successfully start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play, Fever. 

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis preformed compares different crowdfunding campaigns based on their launch dates and funding goals. In addition to analyzing and sorting the data, we created visualizations so Louise could see outcomes in a form thatâ€™s easier to understand and highlights useful information.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

One of the areas we wanted to consider was timing for campaigns. We created a table and line with markers chart that showed how many successful, failed, and cancelled theater campaigns there were based on which month they launched on. This data was captured between 2009 through 2017. The results show that May and June had the highest success rate to start a theater campaign. It also showed that December had around the same amount of successful and failed theater campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Another area we wanted to examine was looking at the outcomes based on the goal amount. We created a chart and a table that broke the goals down into dollar amount ranges and calculated the number of successful, failed, or cancelled play campaigns. We then calculated the percentage of successful, failed, or cancelled projects and used this information in our line chart. When the goal was less than $1000 for 186 play projects, it had the highest success percentage and lowest failed percentage. In this scenario, around 76% of play campaigns that had goals of less than $1000 were successful and around 24% of play campaigns failed. Also looking at goals between $1000 to $4999, there were 534 total play projects, and they had a success rate of around 73% and around 27% failed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. May and June look like the best time to start a theater campaign since they had the most successful projects and the highest number of total theater projects during those months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Having a goal between less than $1000 to $4999 for a play campaign has the highest success percentage and yields the highest number of total play projects.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset consisted of 4,000 crowdfunding projects and majority of the campaigns were in the US. If Louise is looking to do another project in a different country like Great Britain, her sample size would be smaller to work with.   

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
