# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

During this project, we use Excel as a tool to better understand and display a large amount of data from Kickstarter. Kickstarter is a platform that allows people to showcase their projects and helps them start a campaign to raise money to fund their projects. This data set that we were given is composed of 4,000 different campaigns ranging in different categories during the years of 2009-2017. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to help Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, analyze and sort the Kickstarter data so she can successfully start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play, Fever. Using Excel, we will create various charts and tables that will help display the information in a meaningful way to Louise. Based on our findings, Louise will be able to make educated decisions regarding her play campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis preformed compares different crowdfunding campaigns based on their launch dates and funding goals. In addition to analyzing and sorting the data, we created visualizations so Louise could see outcomes in a form thatâ€™s easier to understand and highlights useful information.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

One of the areas we wanted to consider was timing for campaigns. We created a pivot table and line with markers chart that showed how many successful, failed, and cancelled theater campaigns there were based on which month they launched on. This data was captured between 2009 through 2017. The results show that May and June had the highest success rate to start a theater campaign. It also showed that December had around the same amount of successful and failed theater campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Another area we wanted to examine was looking at the outcomes based on the goal amount. We created a chart and a table that broke the goals down into dollar amount ranges and calculated the number of successful, failed, or cancelled play campaigns. We then calculated the percentage of successful, failed, or cancelled projects and used this information in our line chart. When the goal was less than $1000 for 186 play projects, it had the highest success percentage and lowest failed percentage. In this scenario, around 76% of play campaigns that had goals of less than $1000 were successful and around 24% of play campaigns failed. Also looking at goals between $1000 to $4999, there were 534 total play projects, and they had a success rate of around 73% and around 27% failed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I have used Excel for work but have never used it to present or sort through data in a meaningful way. My first issue I encountered during this module was trying to determine why none of my functions were working. For work, I use a lot of pipe delimited files so I changed my computer settings years ago to have my line seperators as pipes instead of commas. After realizing that the line seperator was the issue, I was then able to write my functions apporpriately. This was a lesson that you can't always just copy and paste functions. Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts were something new to me and presented somewhat of a challenge but the videos and examples during the module were very helpful.

## Results

### Conclusions on Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals

For this project, we created two tables and two charts that compared different crowdfunding campaigns based on their launch dates and funding goals. After analyzing the Outcomes based on Launch Date line chart, May and June look like the best time to start a theater campaign since they had the most successful projects and the highest number of total theater projects during those months. We also saw that in December, the number of successful projects is almost equal to the number of failed projects. I would recommend not launching a campaign for theater in December since the success rate is not that much higher than the failed rate. When also reviewing the Outcomes based on Goals chart, we determined having a goal between less than $1000 to $4999 for a play campaign has the highest success percentage and yields the highest number of total play projects. 

### Limitations

This dataset had a lot of information and was quite big. Some limitations I encountered were although the dataset consisted of 4,000 crowdfunding projects, majority of the campaigns were in the US. If Louise is looking to do another project in a different country like Great Britain, her sample size would be smaller to work with. I also think there are some limitations around the word "successful" and "failed". I would like to know what the criteria is for a campaign project to be "successful". Another limitation is that this data was taken from 2009-2017, it would be better to have more recent data.

### Potential Graphs and Charts

In Module 1, we created a "Descriptive Statistics" table, I thought that table had a lot of great information. In this table, we calculated the Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Upper Quartile, Lower Quartile, and IQR for the goal amount and the pledged amount. It showed that failed campaigns had high fundraising goals in comparison to what was pledged. I think another chart or table that would be helpful would be comparing how long campaigns lasted. It would be interesting to see if projects were more successful if they had more time to raise more money and get more backers.
